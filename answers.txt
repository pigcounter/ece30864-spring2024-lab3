a) In a non-Agile project, the Project Manager is equivalent to the Product Owner. Product Owners are needed because they often provide funding for and are responsible for the oversight of the project as a whole.

b) Product Owners are resposible for managing product backlogs, prioritizing features, and collaborating with stakeholders and development teams. On the other hand, Scrum Maters are more focused with ensuring that the scrum is followed and facilitating work among a large scrum team.

c) 1) Sprint Planning Meeting
        - Determine what to complete in the coming sprint
        - Move stories in sprint scope from backlog to current sprint
    2) Daily Scrum/Standup Meeting:
        - Team members discuss work completed
        - Also create plans for upcoming work
    3) Sprint Retrospective Meeting:
        - Discuss work complete and move incomplete work to backlog
        - Meeting is used to close the sprint

d)  Epic: Larger grouping that contains stories/tasks/bugs that are all related to each other in a project
    Story: The "smallest unit" of work that needs to be done: usually tasks come from these stories.
    Bug: An issue that has been found in the project that needs fixed.
    Task: Something that needs to be completed for the project to progress.
